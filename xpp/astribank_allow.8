.SH NAME
astribank_allow \- License Xorcom Astribank (xpp) capabilities.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B astribank_allow \-D \fIdevice-path\fR [ options ]

.B astribank_allow [\-h]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Modern Astribanks (with USB product id's 116x) contain capabilities
that may be licensed.

.B astribank_allow
is used to upload/download the licensing information to/from the device.

Uploading a valid license file to an Astribank, changes its capabilities.
The change becomes effective after a firmware reset (either by powering
the device off and on again, or via the \fBastribank_tool\fR full reset option).

Downloading license from the device, produces a valid license file for its
current capabilities. This may be backed up, so the device may be later
restored to its previous capabilities.

The license file contains both a human readable description of the
device capabilities for the end user and a hash of the licensing
information used by Xorcom to generate/modify licensed capabilities.

.SH OPTIONS
.B \-D

Required. The device to read from/write to. On modern UDEV-based system
this is usually /dev/bus/usb/\fIbus_num\fR/\fIdevice_num\fR,
where \fIbus_num\fR and \fIdevice_num\fR are the first two numbers in the
output of lsusb(8).
On older systems that use usbfs, it is usually
/proc/bus/usb/\fIbus_num\fR/\fIdevice_num\fR.
